ANSWERS TO PART 1 QUESTION:
1) Evidence of fraudulent transactions
Looking at the transactions unde $2 per user as well as total and average amounts spent by user, it seems that the users Crystal Clark (19 under $2 transactions, total spend $15763 and average spend $74), Crystal Clark (26 under $2 transactions, total spend $15821 and average spend $72) and Sean Taylor (18 under $2 transactions, total spend $11429 and average spend $82) might have had fraudulent transaction since they have high number of transactions under $2 as well as much higher total and average spend compare to most other users (8-9 times higer).  This could indicate fraud.
2) 7 am to 9 am -  7 high amoun transactions over $1000
3) After 9 am - 42 high amoun transactions over $1000.  It doesn't seem like 7 am - 9 am has higher amount of fraudulent transaction vs the rest of the day
4) The Merchants with higher chances of fraudulent transactions are Cooper, Carpenter and Jackson, Johnson-Fuller, Romero-Jordan, Thornton-Williams and Baxter-Smith.  They have higher average and total transaction amounts
